                    <p>i've always believed that <span class="highlight">simplicity</span> and <span class="highlight">accessibility</span> are two sides of the same coin. growing up, i was fascinated by how the most elegant solutions were often the simplest ones. this wasn't just about minimalism – it was about clarity of purpose. every element should exist for a reason, every interaction should feel natural. when i design, i constantly ask myself: "could this be simpler? could this be clearer?" it's not about stripping away complexity – sometimes complexity is necessary – but about thoughtfully organizing it. like a well-designed map that helps you navigate a complex city, good design should guide users without overwhelming them.</p>
                    <div class="accent-circle right"></div>
                    <p>the principles of <span class="highlight">iteration</span> and <span class="highlight">balance</span> have shaped my entire approach to design. i learned early in my career that the best products aren't born from grand, isolated visions – they emerge through constant refinement and careful observation. data guides us but shouldn't control us. i've seen how the sweet spot often lies between quantitative insights and human intuition. this balance extends to every aspect of my work: between aesthetics and functionality, between innovation and reliability, between systematic thinking and creative exploration. it's about finding that perfect middle ground where technology meets human needs, where metrics meet emotions, and where efficiency meets delight.</p>
                    <div class="accent-circle"></div>
                    <p>i am 23 years old, living in zagreb, croatia. being a product designer and creating intuitive and user-friendly experiences is my passion. i went to technical and natural sciences high school ruđer bošković osijek, where i studied graphic design and multimedia. finishing school made me realize that i'm more interested in the user experience and the interaction between the user and the product, than designing pretty logos and creating websites.</p>
